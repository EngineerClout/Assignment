# Palindrome Check Using Stack and Queue (Sourced from HackerRank Day 18)

## Problem Description

A **palindrome** is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward.  
Examples include `"madam"`, `"racecar"`, and `"level"`.

Your task is to determine whether a given string `s` is a palindrome by using both a **stack** and a **queue**.

---

## Assignment Deliverables

You are required to:

- Implement a function named `is_palindrome_using_stack`.
- The function should receive a string as input and return `True` if the string is a palindrome, or `False` otherwise.
- Use both a **stack** and a **queue** in your implementation to verify the palindrome.
- A set of test cases will be used to validate the correctness of your implementation.

---

## Function Signature

```python
def is_palindrome_using_stack(s: str) -> bool:
    pass  # Your implementation here
```

---

## How to Solve the Problem

To check if the string is a palindrome:

1. Initialize a **stack** and a **queue**.
2. For each character in the string `s`:
   - Push it onto the stack.
   - Enqueue it into the queue.
3. Pop characters from the stack and dequeue from the queue one by one.
4. Compare the popped and dequeued characters:
   - If all the characters match, then the string is a palindrome.
   - If any character does not match, then the string is not a palindrome.

---

## Constraints

- `1 <= len(s) <= 50`
- The input string `s` contains **only lowercase English letters**.

---
## Sample Output
```
For the input `"racecar"`:
```
True
```

For the input `"hello"`:

```
False
## Final Step â€“ Push to GitHub Repository

This is an important part of the assignment.

After completing your `is_palindrome_using_stack` function, you **must** push your changes to the **GitHub Classroom repository**.

Make sure your repository contains the following files:

- `circular_dll.py`
- `palindrome.py`

You are expected to **create and commit `palindrome.py`**, and ensure that both files appear in the GitHub repository view.

See the following image of the expected visual end.

Make sure your final commit has both files clearly visible before submission.
