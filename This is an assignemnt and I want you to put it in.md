# Assignment: Palindrome Checker Using Stack

## Problem Description

A **palindrome** is a word or sequence that reads the same backward as forward (for example, "level" or "madam").

Your task is to write a function that determines whether a given string is a palindrome. The function should utilize the concept of a **stack** in its implementation.

---

## Requirements

- Implement a function with the following signature:

```

def is_palindrome_using_stack(s: str) -> bool:

```

- The function should return `True` if the input string is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.

---

## Input

- A single string `s` containing only lowercase English letters.
- The length of `s` will be between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.

---

## Output

- Return a boolean value:
- `True` if `s` is a palindrome.
- `False` if `s` is not a palindrome.

---

## Constraints

- Do **not** use built-in string reversal methods.

---

## Notes

- You are expected to use a **stack** data structure as part of your solution.
- Focus on writing clean, readable, and well-documented code.

---

## Submission

- Submit your solution as a `.py` file containing only your function definition.
